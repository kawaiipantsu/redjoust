DNS TXT Fingerprinting of Online Vendor verification string

This is an example on how you can use the fingerprint JSON
file to enable detecting txt strings in your own code, you
don't need to use Redjoust to get that functionality etc.

The JSON file is however maintained by Redjoust for Redjoust
But how you use it otherwise is completely up to you :)

Enjoy!
