> Its beginning to take shape !! I now have almost all internal logic in place, so i can now begin to develop a bit more on the actual intel gathering items.

## What it looks like (what i'm going for)

I have included 2 screenshots, i will update them regularly :)

- First is just the main webapp default page where you can see i have set TARGEt and MODE and then relevent gather info items are shown and also target is parses and split out into other menu sections with each their own relevent gather info items!
- Second is just other cases i wanted to show off, this is etc the Toolbox view of Base64
