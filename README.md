## TODO list (what i want to get done short term)

- Way to find childs/processes of async things running
- Make Preferences window useful
- Add "safety" features as, toggle alerting if red-team mode is active
- Preparing for more config settings
  - default NS server to use (static or system)
  - proxy usage
  - tor usage
  - specific item options
- proxy/tor/socks logic
- Getting PowerMonitor to work, so i can attach to System OS idle/suspend events
- Make logic to set your target (ip, hostname or domain)
- Make default first page show easy 3 button layout - Set mode, set target, run
- Make simple DNS lookup module ~~(json return)~~ to test output for page

## What it looks like (what i'm going for)

This is still just a boilerplate on what layout i'm trying to go for, this might change in the near future i have no idea. But so far this is what it's going to look like. Also not functionality at all and placeholders. Only thing really working is the small user/sys info box top right and the toggle switch bottom right for dark/light theme.

More to come soon ! I hope :)
